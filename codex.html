    <h1>The Codex</h1>

    <p>
    The Codex holds the 5 Sacred Domains — each representing a core energetic field that governs the human journey across both physical and spiritual planes. The allocation of 888 NFTs per category (except for Love's 892) represents sacred numerology integrated into blockchain permanence.
    </p>

    <h2 class="health">Health — 888 Blessings</h2>
    <p>
    Health is the foundation of all manifestation. Without a stable vessel, the mind cannot focus, the spirit cannot expand, and abundance cannot flow. The 888 Health Blessings calibrate the body's cells, nervous system, and energetic currents. The colour <strong>emerald-turquoise</strong> reflects nature’s healing frequency, associated with life force, rejuvenation, and cellular coherence. In ancient numerology, 8 signifies infinity, but 888 amplifies this into cycles of restoration and vitality.
    </p>

    <h2 class="prosperity">Prosperity — 888 Blessings</h2>
    <p>
    Prosperity represents the balanced exchange of energy — financial, relational, karmic, and material. The blockchain resonates with this field, as each crypto transaction mirrors the ancient laws of energetic reciprocity. The <strong>golden hue</strong> signifies divine wealth, freedom, and the solar force of empowered circulation. The Prosperity Blessings were encrypted to support the owner’s expansion not through greed, but through aligned stewardship.
    </p>

    <h2 class="love">Love — 892 Blessings</h2>
    <p>
    Love is the great overflow — never fully contained, never fully predictable. The Codex was originally designed to balance equally, yet Spirit insisted Love would carry an <strong>extra 4 blessings</strong>, for love always breaks structure. The <strong>rose quartz hue</strong> represents universal affection, self-acceptance, devotion, and divine union. The Love Blessings dissolve inner resistance and guide one towards authentic relationships, soulful romance, and self-love in its highest form.
    </p>

    <h2 class="success">Success — 888 Blessings</h2>
    <p>
    Success governs action, discipline, and sovereignty. The blockchain honours those who execute; thus, these blessings strengthen execution while protecting against burnout, ego-driven ambition, or misalignment. The <strong>royal blue hue</strong> activates mental precision, strategic calm, and visionary leadership. Every success is built on the daily integrity of purpose. The Success Blessings encode the holder’s ability to convert vision into reality while remaining energetically grounded.
    </p>

    <h2 class="clarity">Clarity — 888 Blessings</h2>
    <p>
    Clarity is where all manifestation begins. Without clear thought, the other domains cannot flourish. Clarity dissolves confusion, overthinking, emotional fog, and paralysis. The <strong>violet amethyst hue</strong> mirrors ancient crystal knowledge used by oracles and initiates to receive divine transmissions. The Clarity Blessings sharpen intuition, open the third eye, and create the mental stillness necessary for high-level manifestation.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
    "The 4444 Blessings form a living energetic grid — visible to none, but felt by all who align."
